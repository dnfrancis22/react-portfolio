              My name is Dennis Francis. I am currently enrolled in the Full Stack
              Flex Boot Camp with GA Tech. My back ground is in Exhibit Design and
              the design of large format graphics. I was in the Exhibit industry
              for 20 years. I enjoyed Exhibit Design because I not only was able
              to create a pretty picture but it also lead to the construction of a
              physical structure. In Web Development I am doing something very
              similar. I am creating a great design but also creating the bones of
              the web site. Along with making sure it all works together. I plan
              to blend my skills as a designer with the skills I learn in web
              development to be come a great Full Stack Web Developer.
