# responsive-portfolio

**Description**

This is a site that I created to display information about my self. There are four pages. Home, About Me, and Portfolio page. The About Me page is where I have a short biography about my self. I also share links to my LinkedIn site, GitHub and my email address. The Portfolio page currently displays six of the top projects that I have completed. As I complete more projects I will add them here. On any of the pages if you click on the resume link in the navbar you will be taken to Google Docs to view my resume.
